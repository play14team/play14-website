## The Debriefing Cube

The most important part of a game, except the fun of playing, is the debrief. Unfortunately, most of the time facilitators are not so great at debriefing the game they proposed.

The [Debriefing Cube](http://thedebriefingcube.com/) will help you improve your debriefs by using the six lenses

- Goal
- Process
- Group dynamics
- Communication
- Emotions
- Take-away

You can order the wooden version of the cube [here](http://shop.kilearning.net/).

## Oblique Strategies for leaders

Our friend and organizer of #play14 Basel, [Bernhard Sterchi](../_players/bernhard-sterchi.md) edits great boxes of [Oblique Strategies for Leaders](https://www.palladio.net/product/oblique-strategies-for-leaders/)

A good idea is only good at the right time and place. If you read a book, listen to a speaker, or watch a video, you may get new ideas that are very useful – somewhere, sometime. But they most certainly are not adapted to your context, and may come at the wrong moment.

This is why the best leaders take such ideas and weave them into their regular self-reflection. The problem with this: you tend to forget good ideas before you find the first instance to actually practice their application.

Now imagine you get one hundred teasers that trigger off your reflection in novel ways. That’s what Oblique Strategies for Leaders do.
