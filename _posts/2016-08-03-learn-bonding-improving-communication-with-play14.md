  #play14 started in Luxembourg in 2014 to provide a forum for people who enjoying playing, learning and sharing. The movement has spread across Europe, with off-shoots in London, Hamburg, Beirut and Milano. Last year, one of our Agile Coaches, Lloyd Jones, attended #play14 and created his high-paced and fun game Ball Runner, which he shared a couple of months back at an AWA meetup.
