  People look at me funny when I say that spent a weekend at a Play conference. Yes, we do laugh a lot, it is fun and there is a lot of learning to be had from play. #play14 is a conference where you "develop your facilitation skills, increase your ability to accompany change in your organization, foster your creativity and improve your capacity to innovate."

People look at me funny when I say that spent a weekend at a Play conference. Yes, we do laugh a lot, it is fun and there is a lot of learning to be had from play. #play14 is a conference where you "develop your facilitation skills, increase your ability to accompany change in your organization, foster your creativity and improve your capacity to innovate."

#play14 was started in Luxembourg by a group of Agile- and Scrum Coaches (think software development) and the growing fanbase is now reaching a wider audience all over Europe. This year's London event attracted a majority of agile/scrum coaches, a scattering of executive coaches (including myself), organisational /leadership development experts and a few outliers. What unites us is our work with teams and groups and the shared philosophy that play can be the best way to learn.

We kick-off the conference in an unconventional way: that is, there is no agenda until the participants contribute and build the agenda themselves.
