Directory structure

- Events markdown files should be placed into the [\_events](_events) directory.
  - The file name should respect the template `<yyyy-mm>.md`.
  - Events images should be placed into the `images/events/<event-name>` sub-directory. Their size should be 600x500.

## Event Front Matter metadata

Here is an example of the metadata you can provide in the [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) part of an event file using [YAML](http://yaml.org/).

```yaml
layout: event # layout should always be 'event'

title: Luxembourg 2017 # default is location and year of the event
category: luxembourg # the location of the event in lowercase, used to filter on the events list

### Registration

There are different way to integrate a registration form on the website, depending on the ticketing system you are using.

#### Link registration

The simplest way to integrate registration is to provide the URL to any external system that will handle registration. When clicking the _Register_ button on the event web page, it will open a new tab pointing to the given URL.

```yaml
registration:
  type: link
  url: https://play14-luxembourg2017.eventbrite.com
```

#### Form registration

You can also integrate a registration form directly into the event page. To do that, you first need to declare the type of registration in the Front Matter YAML section.

```yaml
registration:
  type: form
```

Then you simply add the form (code usually generated by your ticketing system) in as plain HTML in the Markdown section of the page.

One important thing is to put a `title="Registration"` attribute to the _anchor_ tag so that, when clicking on the _Register_ button, the page will be automatically scolled down to the registration form.

```markdown
## Registration

<a title="Registration" href="https://www.weezevent.com/?c=sys_widget" class="weezevent-widget-integration" target="_blank" data-src="https://www.weezevent.com/widget_billeterie.php?id_evenement=323358&lg_billetterie=2&code=42627&resize=1&width_auto=1&color_primary=00AEEF" data-width="650" data-height="600" data-id="323358" data-resize="1" data-width_auto="1" data-noscroll="0" data-nopb="0">Registration</a><script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.weezevent.com/js/widget/min/widget.min.js"></script>
```

#### Weezevent registration

When the chosen ticketing platform is [Weezevent](https://weezevent.com/), we implemented a specific integration to simplify things.

All you need to do is define the type of integration as `weezevent` in the Front Matter YAML and then specify the `eventId` and `code` that are provided by Weezevent when generating a widget.

The values can be found in the URL in the `data-src` attribute of the widget.

```
data-src="https://www.weezevent.com/widget_billeterie.php?id_evenement=323358&lg_billetterie=2&code=42627&resize=1&width_auto=1&color_primary=00AEEF"
```

The Front Matter YAML should look like that:

```yaml
registration:
  #type of registration should be weezevent
  type: weezevent
  #the value of the id_evenement URL parameter
  eventid: 374193
  #the value of the code URL parameter
  code: 16876
```

#### Eventbrite registration

When the chosen ticketing platform is [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/), we implemented a specific integration to simplify things.

```yaml
registration:
  #type of registration should be eventbrite
  type: eventbrite
  #the id of your event on Eventbrite
  eventid: 64806410719
```

## Game Front Matter metadata

Here is an example of the metadata you can provide in the [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) part of an event file using [YAML](http://yaml.org/).

```yaml
layout: game # layout should always be 'game'

title: "X + Y game" # the title of the game
category: game # the type of game in lowercase (game, icebreaker, warmup), used to filter on the games list
tags: # some of the values / learning objectives of the game
  - trust
  - empathy
  - zoom out
  - collaboration
  - competitive

authors: # the list of people who wrote the game documentation down (should match the 'name' of a player in the directory _players)
  - Chris Caswell
originators: # the list of people who originally proposed the game (should match the 'name' of a player in the directory _players)
  - Leon-Cosmin Lupu
  - Dragos Marius Jumanca
firstplayed: Luxembourg 2015 # the first event the game was played at (should match the 'title' of an event in the directory _events)
scale: Min 6, Max 16 # indicates the min/max number of people for the game
timebox: 30-45 mins # indicates the min/max timebox for the game

# a description for the game, that will appear as a summary
description: We have a natural tendency to optimise the world immediately around us and focus on personal or team success. Often this can be to the detriment of others  and the wider organisation which ultimately affects their success. This game exploits this aspect of human nature to demonstrate that localised sub-optimisation can have a dramatic effect when we look at the bigger picture.

materials: # materials that are necessary to play the game
  - TV or Projector
  - Board or Flipchart and pens
  - Post it notes
  - Timer
  - Game board and scoring chart

resources: # internal / external resources needed to play the game
  - name: Game board # name of the resource
    url: /files/x-y-game/x-y-game-board.xlsx # url to the resource

preparations: # preparations you should do before you can play the game
  - Print copies of the scoring chart
  - Make a simple decision board for each department to indicate the option theyâve chosen (E.G. | Team name | Decision X or Y | )
  - Two post its per team, one with X and the other with Y

safety: # some safety warnings for some games that can trigger mixed feelings/reactions amongst participants
  - title: Stress
    description: This game is highly valuable and educational, but to achieve this it creates an environment of stress, frustration and conflict. Be sure that is it safe for your team to experience these emotions and take the time to follow this game with a team building exercise.
  - title: Christmas Bonus
    description: Use a box of chocolates as the âChristmas Bonusâ in this game, and when nobody actually wins (company has failed) at the end of game, share the chocolates during the reflection to begin to defuse.

images: # images illustrating the game (size 800x533)
