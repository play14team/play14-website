Directory structure

- Events markdown files should be placed into the [_events](_events)  directory. 
  - The file name should respect the template `<yyyy-mm>.md`.
  - Events images should be placed into the `images/events/<event-name>` sub-directory. Their size should be 600x500.
- Games markdown files should be placed into the [_games](_games) directory.
  - The file name should respect the template `<game-name>.md`.
  - Game images should be placed into the `images/games/<game-name>` sub-directory. Their size should be 800x533.

You should NOT have to modify any other directory or file.

timebox: 30-45 mins # indicates the min/max timebox for the game

# a description for the game, that will appear as a summary
description: We have a natural tendency to optimise the world immediately around us and focus on personal or team success. Often this can be to the detriment of others  and the wider organisation which ultimately affects their success. This game exploits this aspect of human nature to demonstrate that localised sub-optimisation can have a dramatic effect when we look at the bigger picture.

preparations: # preparations you should do before you can play the game
    - Print copies of the scoring chart
    - Make a simple decision board for each department to indicate the option they’ve chosen (E.G. | Team name | Decision X or Y | )
    - Two post its per team, one with X and the other with Y

safety: # some safety warnings for some games that can trigger mixed feelings/reactions amongst participants
  - title: Stress
    description: This game is highly valuable and educational, but to achieve this it creates an environment of stress, frustration and conflict. Be sure that is it safe for your team to experience these emotions and take the time to follow this game with a team building exercise.
