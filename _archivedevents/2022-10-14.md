### Disclaimer

#### VAT

At this point in time invoices may not include any German VAT, as we are still in the clarification process for the form of organisation of the event.

#### Cancellation

If for some reason, we have to cancel the event, participants will get a full refund. We need a minimum amount of people to make it feasible. We will not be liable for any travel costs incurred by participants if a course is cancelled. Please wait until 1 week before the event to book travel, or contact us to find out the status of a course.

If a participant wishes to cancel a place, they may do so and receive a full refund minus any transaction fees up until one calendar month before the event. We are able to offer a 50% refund up until 2 weeks before the event. After this period we are unable to offer a refund as we will have committed to costs for the participant’s place.

If however a participant finds someone else to take their place then we would offer a refund at any time, minus any costs incurred with the transaction.

#### Photography and Video

Certain sessions during the event are filmed and recorded. If you do not wish to be included in any footage or photography, please contact us and we will ensure that you are not included. If you do not contact us, you consent to being filmed and recorded and (hence maybe) included in this and subsequent versions in any and all media, worldwide, without limitation of time. You can contact us: munich@play14.org

#### Contact Details

Contact details for participants will be kept strictly private and will be shared only with the organisers.

#### Limitation of liability

If we breach the terms of an agreement, or you seek compensation and damages for any claim or claims arising out of any contract between us for whatever reason, your remedy will be limited to damages. Our liability will not exceed the cost of the registration fee received, except in the case of injury or death or any person.

With the exception of the above paragraph, we shall not be liable to you, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence and breach of statutory duty), strict liability, or otherwise whatsoever:

- for any loss of profit, business, contracts or revenues
- for failure to achieve anticipated savings in costs
- for any special, indirect or consequential damage of any nature whatsoever arising directly or indirectly out of the services we offer, or of any error or defect caused by us, UNLESS you inform us in writing before you book a place on each event, of any particular circumstances covered above.

Each of the foregoing points is to be construed as a separate limitation (applying and surviving even if for any reason one or other of these points is held inapplicable or unreasonable in any circumstances) and shall remain in force notwithstanding termination of any contract between us.
