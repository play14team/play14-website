## Important

Due to some unforeseen events, **we have changed location**.  
#play14 Netherlands will now be hosted by **Xebia in Amsterdam**.

## Thursday evening

We will have a **get together** event on Thusday evening.
However, it will not be at Xebia like the rest of the event.

We will gather at the [Volks Hotel](https://www.volkshotel.nl/en/) at 6 PM for some ice breakers and games.
