## What is special about Play14 "Outdoor"?

- you are outdoor all day
- we will be building our own camp
- we will be cooking our delicious menus at the fire
- there is a shelter in case of heavy rain
- you can camp onsite, it's included in the price

Real development happens outside the comfort zone!

### Camping on site

It is possible, even recommended, to camp on site. You will need to **bring your own tent** for that. Alternatively, you can **rent a tent** on site, for a 20 CHF per night. If you are interested, please contact us on [emmental@play14.org](mailto:emmental@play14.org?subject=Rent a tent).

Your third option will be to sleep in the Teepee, witch can be heated inside with a cosy fireðŸ”¥. If you are interested, please contact us on [emmental@play14.org](mailto:emmental@play14.org?subject=Sleep in a tipi).

We also recommend that you **bring warm clothes and blankets/sleeping bags**. I can get pretty chilly in mid-October in Switzerland. So plan for that in advance.

If you stay, you will also have access to the sauna. So don't hesitate to bring your spa kit.

### Find a hotel nearby

If you are not into sleeping on the floor and chilling next to the wood fire, you can find a [hotel nearby](http://www.thurm-signau.ch/de/hotel)
