## DESCRIPTION

#play14 is an informal, serious games gathering following Open Space unconference format.
Together we’ll explore games and playful approaches to coach teams, organizations... or just to have fun.

#play14 is playful with a purpose: Coaches, facilitators, trainers, game and innovation experts find an open playground to inspire each other and co-create transformative experiences. We gather to grow individually and as a community.

Never heard about Serious games? They are gamified simulations of real-life problems, and playing them is a great way to learn and understand. Good and widespread examples of such games are Lego Scrum and Kanban pizza. Common themes are people motivation, self-organization or process inefficiency.

2020 is going to be the first time this event is being organized in the Czech Republic.
