    <h4>What we do with Miro</h4>
    <p>
      In order to facilitate games online, you may need to use a digital
      workspace to allow players to share a playful experience with stickies,
      images and more.

      is a great tool to facilitate workshops online. At #play14, we use it to
      create and facilitate games. For example, we used it for our

      >, even though #play14 is not technically speaking a school or education
      organization. This gives us the opportunity to use Miro to facilitate our
      events and games onlinefor one year without bearing any cost.

    <p>
      #play14 being a non-profit this is very useful for us, and we are very
      grateful to Miro for offering us this opportunity.
