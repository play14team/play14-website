        <h4>What we do with Miro</h4>
        <p>
            In order to facilitate games online, you may need to use a digital workspace to allow players 
            to share a playful experience with stickies, images and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://miro.com/?utm_source=play14.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=play14">Miro</a> is a great tool to facilitate workshops online. 
            At #play14, we use it to create and facilitate games. For example, we used it for our <a href="/events/online/2020-05">very first online event</a>.

        <h4>Many thanks to Miro</h4>
        <p>
            The people behind Miro were kind enough to provide #play14 with a free <a href="https://help.miro.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017730473-Education-Plan" target="_blank">Education Plan</a>, 
            even though #play14 is not technically speaking a school or education organization.
            This gives us the opportunity to use Miro to facilitate our events and games onlinefor one year without bearing any cost.
        </p>
        <p>
            #play14 being a non-profit this is very useful for us, and we are very grateful to Miro for offering us this opportunity.
