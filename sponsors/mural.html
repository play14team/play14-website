    <h4>What we do with Mural</h4>
    <p>
      In order to facilitate games online, you may need to use a digital
      workspace to allow players to share a playful experience with stickies,
      images and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://mural.co">Mural</a> is a great tool to facilitate
      workshops online. At #play14, we use it to create and facilitate games.
      For example, we used it for our
      <a href="/events/online/2020-05">very first online event</a>.
