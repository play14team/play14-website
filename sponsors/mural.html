        <h4>What we do with Mural</h4>
        <p>
            In order to facilitate games online, you may need to use a digital workspace to allow players 
            to share a playful experience with stickies, images and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://mural.co">Mural</a> is a great tool to facilitate workshops online. 
            At #play14, we use it to create and facilitate games. For example, we used it for our <a href="/events/online/2020-05">very first online event</a>.
