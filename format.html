      <h2>What is an unconference ?</h2>
      <p><strong>#play14</strong> is organized as an unconference, a conference format that follows the 
      <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology#Guiding_principles_and_one_law' target='_blank'>Open Space Technology</a>
      </p> 
      <p>In this format, <strong>attendees are also session contributors</strong>. Anyone who wants to initiate a topic can claim a time slot in the agenda, 
        and the schedule is done every morning, on the spot, as we will explain later.
      </p>
      <p>Once you are there, the <strong>organizers job is over</strong>. They have provided a location, food and drinks 
        for the rest of the event, then it's <strong>up to you as a participant to make it a great event</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>Check out the <a href="/files/Open-Space-Principles.pdf" target="_blank">funny drawings</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/agilesensei">Claudio Perrone</a></p>
      <h3>Principles</h3>
      <p>There are some simple rules for participants.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Whoever comes is the right people</strong>
            <p>As a facilitator, you should welcome anyone who has decided to join your session, and not be frustrated if you expected different people.
            <br>As a participant, you should be ready to collaborate with anyone.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Whenever it starts is the right time</strong>
            <p>As a facilitator, if you need some time to prepare, take it. Just think that people might get bored and go join another session. The best is to prepare anything in advance.
            <br>As a participant, there is nothing wrong with joining a session in progress. But respect the people who have already started, and try to jump in quietly.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wherever it is, is the right place</strong>
            <p>You will be offered several spaces for your session. Choose the one that fits your needs as a facilitator or as a participant.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Whatever happens is the only thing that could have</strong>
            <p>Be prepared to be surprised. Don't be annoyed if you get feedback. Don't be disappointed if it doesn't work. Try again if need be.</p>
            </li>
          <li>
            <strong>When it's over, it's over</strong>
            <p>As a facilitator, it's up to you to mind your timebox. The organizers will not do it for your. 
            Keep in mind that the participants of your session might want to go to another session after yours, and that the room might be reserved after.
            Feel free to continue in a different location with whoever is interested.</p>
          </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Law of Two Feet</h3>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class='row'>
    <div class='large-4 columns'>
      <p>Any time a person feels a session is not contributing to their learning, they have the responsibility to themselves to get up and move. 
      That is, use their two feet or four wheels to move to a more interesting place.</p>
      <p> 
        Neither the facilitator nor the other participants should feel offended about that. It's just what it is.
