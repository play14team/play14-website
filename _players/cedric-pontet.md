I am very proud of being one of the founders of **#play14** .

Since it started, it has been nothing but joy and an extraordinary human adventure.
I am so happy to see all the organizers and participants around the world getting so involved.

#play14 belongs to them now.
It's out in the world and that's a great feeling.
