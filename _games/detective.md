The 2 rules are
- Participants always answer for the people on their right side
- If a mistake is done while answering, mainly because the person being asked does not know the correct answer, everyone stands up and switch seat 

Tips
- The person who knows the correct answer should initiate the standing up, while the rest discreetly observe
- Remember that players should always try to tell the truth, to the best of their knowledge
