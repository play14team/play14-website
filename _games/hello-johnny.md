## How to play

#### 1. Johnny

Everyone stands in a circle and everyone is named *Johnny*. 
1. First person to start can go to any other person and greets them: 
    - `Hello Johnny` says the first person  
    - `Hello Johnny` replies the person being greeted
    - `Please, say hello to Johnny, Johnny` says the first person while introducing a third person to the second (can point to anyone in the circle)
2. The second person moves toward the third person
3. The second person introduces himself/herself --> back to 1.

#### 2. Pippa

If someone makes a mistake, they become *Pippa*.
- Everyone else has to refer to them as *Pippa*.
    - `Hello Pippa` 
    - `Hello Johnny`
    - `Please, say hello to Johnny, Pippa` 
- Then
    - `Hello Johnny`
    - `Hello Pippa`
    - `Please, say hello to ...`

#### 3. Flomo

If someone make a mistake while being *Pippa*, they become *Flomo*
- A *Flomo* can do and say anything. 
    - `Hey.... how is it going, dude` while jumping everywhere
    - `Hello Flomo`
    - `Please, say hello to my butt` while spanking their butt
- If someone makes a mistake because of *Flomo*, then *Flomo* becomes *Johnny* again, and the one who made the mistake become either *Pippa* or *Flomo*, depending on the number of mistakes they already did.

## Facilitation

As a facilitator
- Explain the *Johnny* rule at first
- Once people start to get the hang of it, ask them to go faster
- After a while, add the *Pippa* rule
- If people are too slow or hesitate, stop them and tell them they have become *Pippa*
- People should use the exact words. No approximation should be allowed.
- Be very drastic about the rules and push people to go faster. It's funnier that way
- Make sure your remember who is *Johnny* and who is *Pippa*
- If you don't remember, stop the game and ask who is who
- Once everyone is confused enough, add the *Flomo* rule
- There can be as many *Pippa* and *Flomo* as possible
- The goal of a *Flomo* should be to become *Johnny* again, so push them to do crazy things so that others make mistakes
