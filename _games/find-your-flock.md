## SETUP

Everyone in the room is secretly given an animal sound 
- `woof woof` for a dog 
- `meow` for a cat 
- `mooo` for a cow 
- `piu piu` for a bird

Distribute the sounds evenly.

## GAME

- Have all participants close their eyes 
- On the count of three (1,2,3) they should try to find their own kind just by using their ears
