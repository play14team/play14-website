![Setup]({{site.url}}/images/games/troublemakers/troublemakers-rules.png "Setup")

#### PLAYING THE GAME

#### Introduction
Before starting the facilitator of the game needs to explain :
* The game has two phases, “1- During the week end” and “2- Monday morning at the office”
* The differents roles/cards and the associated powers that can be used during the week-end.

![roles]({{site.url}}/images/games/troublemakers/roles.png "Roles")

#### During the week end
1.	“**Everyone**, close your eyes.”
2.	“**Trouble Makers** open your eyes and look for other Trouble Makers.”
3.	“**Trouble Makers**, close your eyes.”
4.	“**Product Owner**, open your eyes. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.”
5.	“**Product Owner**, close your eyes.”
6.	“**Middle Manager**, open your eyes. You may exchange cards between two other players.”
7.	“**Middle Manager**, close your eyes.”
8.	(if any) “**El Facilitator**, open your eyes and look at your card.”
9.	(if any) “**El Facilitator**, close your eyes.”

#### Monday morning at the office (**10 minutes**)
Players have 10 minutes to discuss amongst themselves who they believe the “Trouble Makers” are. 
*	All players may say anything but may **never show their card to anyone**. 
*	After 10 minutes of discussion, **players vote**.
*	After the vote **everyone has to return his card** in order to identify who was right.

### Debriefing the game
As a facilitator, ask to the participants to do the parallel between their current agile implementation.

##### Ask simple questions
> Now; what are the forces for change? what are the forces against change? 

Push some tooling like the **force field analysis** that you can use in an agile transformation.
