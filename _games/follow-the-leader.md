## How to play

* Ask all the participants to form a circle
* Pick one volunteer who will be the first person who will have to guess who the leader is
* Ask that person to exit the room for a minute
* Elect a leader from the circle
* Everyone should mimic the leader's current physical posture
* Call the volunteer back in the room and have her/him stand in the middle of the circle
* The leader starts making small changes in her/his posture
* Everyone in the circle follows the leader changes
* The goal for the person in the middle is to find out who is the leader
* She/He can make as many guesses as necessary
* If it takes time, the leader should exaggerate the changes in posture so that it becomes more obvious to see
* Once the volunteer finds who the leader is, the leader exists the room and will be the next person to guess
* Elect a new leader and continue the game

## Debriefing

* Ask the guessers what quality was needed to be able to find the leader
* Ask about what they felt while in the middle
* Ask the people how it felt to be the leader
* Ask them how it felt to become the guesser
* Ask the people around the circle about their empathy towards the one in the middle

## Take aways

* You need to have a good sense of observation to spot who the leader is
* The circle becomes a system that is frequently changing and adapting, in a subtle manner
* It's hard to see everything at once when you stand in the middle of the circle
* In a system, it's a good thing to take some distance to observe how the system works
