### Setup

Each player writes on 3 or 4 different pieces of white paper names of celebrities.  
Then each player writes on 3 or 4 different pieces of orange paper names of objects or usual things.  
 
### How to play 

Each player selects one white paper and one orange paper.  
Then within one minute, each player has to create a slogan to sell the thing to the celebrity.

Within the next minute, each player must incorporate to the slogan a distinguishing characteristic for the celebrity and the thing must not be named.

The idea is to create a slogan based on the needs of the client and not on the description of the product, following Kotler's approach. 

### Debrief

Have every player read out their slogan before and after, then share ideas on how it improved.
