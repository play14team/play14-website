excerpt: Technology has introduced to us many new forms of communication. Ultimately though none of them can replace the value of a simple face to face conversation, but still we seem to prefer them. It’s easier to write an email or send a text. I feel more conformable writing down my requirement and sending it over. This game is designed to demonstrate the value lost by avoiding face to face conversation.

materials:
    - Tables (1 per team)
    - A2 flip chart paper (2 sheets per team)
    - Packs of colouring pens (1 per team)
    - A4 paper (preferable lined)
    - Blue tack

### HOW TO PLAY
#### SETUP
Ask the group to self organise into even teams (5-10 people).  
Ask for one volunteer per team, someone creative with a good imagination.  
Gather the volunteers, tell the teams to pick table, sit down, make themselves comfortable and  introduce each other.  

Meanwhile with the volunteers, brief them:

* In this game they are customers.
* They lack the ability to draw, but their teams are able to provide a drawing service. 
* You goal is to work with your team to produce a picture on the A2 flip chart paper.
* Think of your favourite place in the world.
* I want you to collaborate with your team to produce a picture of this place.
* The picture should be completed in 10 mins.
* Be passionate, be emotive but also be inclusive. Listen to their ideas and try to incorporate them. If they make a mistake, go with it.

Send the volunteers back to the teams.

#### CONCEPT
This game has three rounds.

* In round 1, the teams will create a picture with complete collaboration.  
* In round 2, the teams will attempt to use words to describe how to re-draw that picture.  
* In round 3, the teams will attempt to use each other's words to draw pictures.  

The teams will experience a wide variety of emotions as this game plays out.  
The teams will discover that the written language is very prohibitive when attempting to give instructions.   
The teams will discover that using written instructions to create something will involve large amounts of assumptions and interpretations, causing them to ultimately to fail.  

#### RULES
In round 1, the customer cannot touch the pens.  
Teams may not see what other teams are producing.  
No photographing! :)

* You have 10 minutes.  
* Questions?  
* Go!  

Keep good time keeping, calling out remaining time every min or two.

Reflection (example questions)  

* Ask people to point out the differences

* Ask why they are different?  
* Ask who here uses email regularly?  
* Ask who here had ever received instruction in an email?

### TAKEAWAYS

* It’s impossible to accurately convey requirements, instruction, need via the written word.  
* Filling in the gaps  
    The less words you use the more assumptions will happen  
    The more words you use, the more interpretations will happen  
* Agile has the principle: The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a team is face-to-face conversation.
