## FACILITATION
* INSTRUCTIONS: 
  * Ok let's make it better
  * Change your chairs to be side to side
  * Rule: Again the instructor must keep the instructions to themselves, but this time the instructor can see what the folder is building.

  * Choose: Who will fold, and who will instruct
  * Instructors raise your hand
* HANDOUT: Give each instructor round two model instructions
* INSTRUCTIONS: 
  * You have 10 minutes to build your model Go!
* REFLECTION: 
  * Let’s share our models :)
  * What was that like?
  * Was it better than back to back?

  * What was it like not being able to see the instructions?
  * Etc

## TIMEBOX
15 mins

# ROUND THREE - FACE TO FACE

## FACILITATION
* INSTRUCTIONS: 
  * Ok let's make it better
  * This time there are no rules and no roles. Everyone can see the instructions. Everyone can build.
* HANDOUT: Give each pair round three model instructions
* INSTRUCTIONS: 
  * You have 10 minutes to build your model Go!
* REFLECTION: 
  * Let’s share our models :)
  * What was that like?
  * Was it better than side to side?
  * Did anything interesting happen?
  * Did you notice that the model was harder yet you all did much better, why was that?
  * Etc

## TIMEBOX
15 mins


# DEBRIEF
* The further you are from face to face collaboration, that harder it becomes.
* Unlimited verbal communication doesn’t really help
* When you break down roles and begin to genuinely work together, magic happens.
