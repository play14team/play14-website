  * You have 10 minutes to build your model Go!
* REFLECTION: 
  * Let’s share our models :)

  * Etc

# DEBRIEF
* The further you are from face to face collaboration, that harder it becomes.
* Unlimited verbal communication doesn’t really help
* When you break down roles and begin to genuinely work together, magic happens.
