excerpt: "This game is a nice alternative to the ball point game, especially when you are travelling. The goal of this exercise is to create and improve a workflow using some of the well known agile techniques like Sprint Planning, Timeboxing, Retrospectives."

materials:
  - Two card decks of 52 cards that have identical backs (same colour, same pattern, etc.)
  - A stop watch

preparations:
  - Space for the team to gather (e.g. some tables or some space on the floor)
  - A table on a flipchart or whiteboard with the following columns
    - estimated time
    - actual raw time
    - number of errors
    - actual time with penalties

### How to play

The goal for the team is ordering the 104 cards as follows:

* 8 stacks of cards sorted by the respective suits
* The Ace needs to be on the bottom and the King on top
* The intervening cards need to be in rank order

Start a round by giving 2 minutes for discussing the strategy (“planning”). 

After this time
* ask for an estimate for achieving the goal (“How long will it take?”). In the first round you might not get a quick answer, just go ahead and start anyway.
* ask for a single person to give you the stop sign. You’re not supposed to listen to anyone else but this person.

When you got the above answers
* drop the shuffled stack of cards face down on the table or the floor and start the time
* watch the participants use their strategy but don’t interfere

As soon as the dedicated person tells you to do so
* stop the time and write it on the flipchart
* check the resulting stacks for mistakes (“review”). Each mistake in the ranking will result in a penalty of 5 seconds. Add these seconds to the time on the flipchart


Get the team talking (“retrospective”) about how their approach worked by asking a couple of open questions like
* How did it work?
* Can you improve it? How?
* Do all of you see it the same way?
* ...

After that give the team 2 minutes for planning, ask for a new estimate and start the next round. Play the game for 3 to 5 rounds as long as the team thinks there’s improvement possbile (or you reach the end of your timebox).
