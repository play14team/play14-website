### Setup

Have people stand up in a circle.

### How to play

The goal is to count to 33 as a group.
However, you have to replace all numbers containing 3 or multiple of 3 by clapping your hands.

* The first person starts counting 1
* The second person, direct neighbor on the left or on the right, counts 2
* The third person, instead of counting to 3, claps his/her hands
* Next person counts 4
* Next person counts 5
* Next person claps
* And so forth…

The person who makes a mistake should be the one starting over to 1.
You stop when the group reaches 33 without mistake.

### Variation
You can make the game even funnier by having the person who makes a mistake do something silly, like doing the walk of shame around the circle, or having everyone booing.
