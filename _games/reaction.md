excerpt: This game is designed to allow participants to experience and reflect on what it's like when two cultures merge. 

learning-objectives:
    - Be mindful of the difficulty and awkwardness of changing cultures, changing teams and so that they can act accordingly.
    - Explicit, visual policies - such as a team charter with ways of working really ease cultural change.

materials:
    - Large Dice, of two colours - 1 of each colour per table
    - Tokens or chips - 20 per player
    - Beakers / Cups to hold the cups - 1 per player

resources:
  - name: Handouts
    url: /files/reaction/Reaction_handout.pdf

preparations:
    - Print copies of the handouts - one per table
    - You need 3 - 4 tables depending on the amount of people. Tables should be separated enough so that the team can sit and move around them.
    - Place one of each dice on each table
    - Place all of the chips in a bowl, or suitable accessible container along side the cups

### REFLECTION

* Who were the winners from round 1?
    * What was it like to join a new table in round 2?
    * How welcome did you feel?
    * In round 2, what was it like when a new player joined your tables?
    * How did you feel about that person?
* Who were the winners from round 2?
    * Did you approach changing teams in round 3 differently?
    * When someone joined your table in round 3, did you do anything differently?
    * What could you have done differently?

### DEBRIEF

* Merging cultures is hard, requiring focused and dedicated effort
* People will naturally assume that elements of their previous culture are true for one that they are joining
* Some cultural rules will be common, whereas others will be completely different
* Culture, and the rule systems supporting it are often entirely implicit to those within the culture 
* When we make elements of culture explicit and visual, the effort required to join is radically reduced
