    - Explicit, visual policies - such as a team charter with ways of working really ease cultural change.

    - You need 3 - 4 tables depending on the amount of people. Tables should be separated enough so that the team can sit and move around them.

### REFLECTION

* Who were the winners from round 1?
    * What was it like to join a new table in round 2?
    * How welcome did you feel?
    * In round 2, what was it like when a new player joined your tables?
    * How did you feel about that person?
* Who were the winners from round 2?
    * Did you approach changing teams in round 3 differently?
    * When someone joined your table in round 3, did you do anything differently?
    * What could you have done differently?

### DEBRIEF

* Merging cultures is hard, requiring focused and dedicated effort
* People will naturally assume that elements of their previous culture are true for one that they are joining
* Some cultural rules will be common, whereas others will be completely different
* Culture, and the rule systems supporting it are often entirely implicit to those within the culture 
* When we make elements of culture explicit and visual, the effort required to join is radically reduced
