## How to play
- Have everyone walk around
- When you say *go*, everyone should introduce themselves to someone else and shake hands
- By shaking hands, they also exchange their first name
  - `Hello, I'm Bob`
  - `Hello, I'm James`
  - `Hello, James`
  - `Hello, Bob`
- They shake hands
- From now on, Bob's name is *James*, and James's name is *Bob*
- James and Bod then move on to the next person, introducing themselves using their new name

The game ends when everyone found their own name back.
