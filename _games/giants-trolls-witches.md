### Setup
Separate people into two groups of equal size

### How to play

Each group decides what they choose to be between
* giants (roaring)
* trolls (zzzzzzzzz)
* witches (gnahaaahhaaa)

Rules are basically the same
* Giants dismember trolls
* Trolls eat witches
* Witches curse giants

Once each group has decided what they are, each group should move toward the other, doing the sound and gesture related to what they chose.
The group that lose the round will give to the other team as many people as the round number
* 1st round --> 1 person
* 2nd round --> 2 people

and so forth.
