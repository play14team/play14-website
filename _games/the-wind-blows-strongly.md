### HOW TO PLAY

Make sure there is one chair per participant except one.
Everyone sits except one person. 

The one who is standing says :
> The wind blows strongly for...

and a characteristic that some people have in common

For example 
> The wind blows strongly for those who have ever been in Asia.

or

> The wind blows strongly for those who have children.


Those who are concerned stand up and go around the group of chairs, looking for another empty seat.
The person who stays on foot then has to continue.

You can stop the game whenever you decide that the people know enough about each other.
