### How to play

Each group of 4 people should stand on 2 sheets of newspaper.  
All members of the group should always step on the newspaper and not lean out of it, holding the position 5 seconds without falling or stepping outside. 

Put on some music. 
While the music is on, each team member walk around the newspaper.
When the music stop, everyone should jump on the newspaper and hold for five seconds.  

Then every team folds (or tear down) the newspaper in half.
Turn the music on again and do it one more time.

Continue as long as the size of the newspaper piece is reasonably big enough.


### Take Aways

Fun and trust.
