excerpt: Players will play a game of battleships with each other. Some players will experience restrictions to how responsive they can be, allowing us to explore the effects.

materials:
    - Battleships game set (4-12 players -> 2 sets, 6-18 players -> 3 sets, etc.)
    - 80 blue pegs per set (Use the excess white pegs, and spray them blue!)

preparations:
    - Divide the participants into an even number of Navies (groups of 1 - 3 players).
    - Tables and chairs
    - It is best that team play opposite each other
    - Flip chart / whiteboard for the score board

## OVERVIEW

This game was created by [James Scrimshire](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesscrimshire/)

- **Goal**: This game is designed to allow participants to experience and reflect on different on the importance of “Responding the change over following a plan”. They will feel the effects of different sized feedback loops, from big bang to empirical. 

- **Learning objectives**: 
    - Responsiveness is vital to success
    - Generally speaking, the tighter we make the learning feedback loop, the more successful we can be
    - Too fast a feedback loop (in this game being able to change strategy at will) is often worse than a small batch. This is because having a pause to consider what we’re going to focus on next and designing a short term strategy for it ensures that there actually is a strategy. Additionally, there is a lot of overhead (waste) in making a decision every turn when hunting for the next ship.
    - The time taken to plan the 40 shots in this game is almost entirely waste

## STRATERGY  
- **MODE**: Small groups of 1-6 players
- **HANDOUT**:
    - Battleships sets with instruction inserts
- **FACILITATION**: 
    - **Decide**: how many team you want. This can be anywhere from 4 upward, depending on the group size and the amount of battleships kits you have.
    - **Instruct**: Ask players to form into teams and sit appropriately. 
    - **Handout**: Give each team a battle ships kit
    - **Inquire**: Check players are familiar with the game, and explain the rules if needed
    - **Instruct**: Ask the teams to place their 5 ships onto the upper grid
    - **Handout**: Give each team a bag of 40 blue pegs
    - **Instruct**: Ask the teams to design their battle strategies by placing the 40 blue pegs onto the lower grid
- **TIMEBOX**: 5-10 mins

## THE BATTLE
- **MODE**: Small groups of 1-6 players
- **FACILITATION**:
    - **Handout**: Allow each team to choose a mission parameter at random
    - **Instruct**: Read your missing parameters, and keep them secret!
    - **Support**: Visit each team, and endure they understand the parameters
    - **IMPORTANT**: If playing with more than 4 teams: ensure each opposing teams have different mission parameters.
    - **Instruct**: Begin the battle
- **TIMEBOX**: 15-20 mins


## DEBRIEF
- **MODE**: All
- **PREP**: 
    - Make this score chart while the game is playing:

        |                | Hits | Sinks |
        |----------------|------|-------|
        | Every shot     |      |       |
        | Every 10 shots |      |       |
        | Every 20 shots |      |       |
        | No change      |      |       |


- **FACILITATION**: 
    - Record the results on the score chart and celebrate the winners 
    - Debrief with questions like:
        - WHAT:
            - Describe your experiences + probing questions to build on their answers
            - Why were you successful / unsuccessful?
            - What did you discover in this game?
        - SO WHAT:
            - What would be the number one takeaway from this?
            - What did you discover about yourself during the activity?
        - NOW WHAT:
            - How is this like something that occurs in our workplace?
            - What does this activity suggest about our daily actions at work?
            - What will we do differently as a result of our insights?
            - What sorts of things could we change from the insights we've generated here
    - Ensure the learning objects we’re revealed in the debrief, otherwise ask more specific debriefing questions to reveal them.


## TIPS
- Let the group who gets the mission parameters that allow them to change their plan at will know may simply use the blue pegs as shot counters
- Set up game boards with 40 white pegs, and 40 red pegs (you don’t need the rest)
- The ships cannot be positioned diagonally (people will try this :) )
- It’s worthwhile checking everyones understanding of the rules are the same - there are some strange and unusual with local variations :)
- If you timebox is threatened, its ok to stop the game at 30 shots.
