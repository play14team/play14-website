### Setup

Have people pair up and face each other.

### How to play

#### Phase 1

* First person counts 1
* Second person counts 2
* First person counts 3
* Second person counts 1
* First person counts 2
* Second person counts 3
* First person counts 1
* And so forth...

#### Phase 2

Start over on the same rhythm but replace the number 1 with a gesture, like clapping your hands, jumping or touching your nose.
Each pair should come up with their own gesture. 
It should be the same within the pair, but different among pairs.

#### Phase 3

Start over on the same rhythm, keep the gesture replacing the number 1, and find a different gesture to replace the number 2.
Your pairs should have now two gestures, and only speak out number 3.

#### Phase 4

In the last phase, the pairs should replace all numbers by 3 different gestures.
