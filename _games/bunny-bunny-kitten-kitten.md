## How to play

#### Round 1
- Everyone forms a circle
- Everyone claps, twice in their hand, once on their lap (following the rhythm We will rock you)
- One person start chanting `Bunny bunny bunny bunny` while mimicking bunny ears by flapping with their hands on top of their head
- That person points to someone else and start clapping again
- The designated person starts chanting `Bunny bunny bunny bunny`...

#### Round 2
- Same setup
- Add a rule that the people on the left and right of the bunny are kittens
- Kittens should turn towards the bunny and chant `Kitten kitten kitten kitten` while scratching the air with their paws

When everyone has had a good laugh, you can all move on to another game.
