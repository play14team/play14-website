## START

- Everyone stands in a circle. 
- You start by sending a *clap* around by turning your body toward your neighbor and clapping in their direction.
- Try to **go as fast as possible** until all get good at it.
- Gradually introduce new rules and if anyone makes a mistake, everyone puts their hands in the air and *freaks out*: starts running and screaming to change positions in the circle, screaming `Freak out`.

## ADD RULES GRADUALLY
- **BOING** put your hands in a defensive position (in front of your face, elbows and wrists together, hands in fists) and say `Boing`: the clap gets *bounced* and changes direction
- **GONG** put your hands together like you are praying and squat while saying `Gong` with a deep voice: everyone has to do the same
- **HIGH-FIVE** shout `High five` and everyone has to go in the middle of the circle to *high five* someone
- **WOOP** send the clap across the circle, followed by a sliding gesture with hands (top hand slides toward the person): clap gets transferred to a person across the circle (important: make it clear by showing with the slide and looking at that person)
