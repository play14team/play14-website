## How to play
This is a variation on the classic rock, paper, scissors.
It is made a little more difficult though, by adding two more possibilities : lizard and spock.

Rules
- Scissors cut paper
- Paper covers rock
- Rock crushes lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spcok smashes scissors
- Scissors decapitate lizard
- Lizard eats paper
- Paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes rock
- and as it always has, rock crushes scissors

All hail Sam Kass !
