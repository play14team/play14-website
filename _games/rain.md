## How to play

* Begin with everyone in a circle
* **Instruction:** I am going to do an action. When I start <the person to your right> will copy me, and then the person to their right and so on until the action spreads around the circle. Remember to only copy the the person to your immediate left.
* **Action 1:** Rub your hands together audibly 
* **Action 2:** (When the rubbing has spread all around the circle), click both hands
* **Action 3:** (When the clicking has spread all around the circle), tap both knees audibly
* **Action 4:** (When the taping has spread all around the circle), stomp both feet and tap both knees audibly
* **Action 5:** (When the stomping and taping has spread all around the circle), tap both knees audibly
* **Action 6:** (When the tapping has spread all around the circle), click both hands
* **Action 7:** (When the clicking has spread all around the circle), rub hands audibly
* **Action 8:** (When the rubbing has spread all around the circle), calmly lower both hands to your sides.
