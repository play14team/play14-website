### How to play

Tell a word the participants should draw/scribble (i.e. Internet).  
The participants have 20 sec to draw.
After the 20 sec. have elapsed, tell the next word.

Do that for 20 rounds.

### Debrief

1. You can see the creative potential of "everybody".
2. It proves everybody can draw/scribble.
3. Depending on the words you chose, you can address a new topics or new subject matter.

Easy to facilitate, great learning.
