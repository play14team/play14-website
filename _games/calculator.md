excerpt: "Imagine, everyone thinks, that good arithmetic is important. And then we play a game that has nothing to do with arithmetic and more fun than titles. People learn a lot about themselves and agile procedures."

## RULES

* Touch each card in the playing field one after the other in the order 1-40
* Each team member must enter the field of play at least 1x
* There may be only 1 person in the playing field at a time
* A second person may enter the field only when the first person has left the playing field

Moderator ensures compliance with the rules.

## TIME/ITERATION

* There are 90 seconds available per game round to solve the problem
* Allow 1 minute before the 1st game round for tactical discussion and planning,
* After each round allow 1 minute for retrospective (what went well, what went well bad, change tactics?) and planning
* 3-5 game rounds

## PLANNING

* How many cards do we touch in 90 seconds?
* When all 40 cards have been touched, start again from 1.
* Let the team plan all rounds beforehand and then take a second
* Write down on the flipchart the planning for each round, at the end the two plannings compare

## FACILITATION

Each time a player breaks the rules, have the team start over from scratch.
