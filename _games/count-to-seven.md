### Setup

Have people stand up in a circle.

### How to play

The goal is to count to 7 as a group.
People will count, one after the other, following these rules:

* If you count 1 to 6, you should touch your right shoulder to indicate that the next person to count will be on your right
* If you count 1 to 6, you should touch your left shoulder to indicate that the next person to count will be on your left
* Instead of counting the number 7, you should cross your arms before you without pronouncing the number, the upper arm indicates the direction for the next person

Go on as long as you wish.
If someone makes a mistake, they should take the walk of shame around the group.

### Variation
You can make the game even harder by replacing number 7 by picking a theme and having everyone saying a word belonging to this theme, i.e. colors, car brands, fruits, ...
