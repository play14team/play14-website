## How to play

This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game, with a nice little twist of evolution.

#### EGG
- All people start as eggs
- An egg hits its head shouting *egg, egg, egg, egg, â€¦*
- When a egg meets another egg, they play rock, paper, scissors
- The winner evolves into a chicken
- In case of equality, they start over until there is a winner

#### Chicken

- A chicken makes chicken noises while flapping its wings
- When a chicken meets another chicken, they play rock, paper, scissors
- The winner evolves into an elephant (because itâ€™s the next logical thing, obviously) 

#### Elephant
- An elephant trumpets while moving its trunk
- When an elephant meets another elephant, they play rock, paper, scissors.
- The winner evolves into superman. 

#### Superman
- As Superman cannot be vanquished, he circles the group, flying with his arm in the air.

## End of the game

At the end of the game, will be left

- one egg
- one chicken
- one elephant
- and many supermen
 
## Benefits
Absolutely none, except the fun it provides ðŸ™‚
