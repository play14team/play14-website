## How to play

Turn around with a bag of multi-color plastic ball.  
Give all participant one plastic ball each.  
Once everyone has a ball, start a speech, very seriously.

> Now that you all have a ball, take some time to look at it.
> This ball represent your knowledge and skills.
> We are all professionals, we are all serious people.
> #play14 is serious business.
> Your boss paid good money so you could come here.
> We have make sure that he is not disappointed when you go back to work next week.

... build up you speech like that for a while.

Then suddenly just say

> Nahhh... we are not here to be serious.
> Now BAAAAAAAL FIIIIIGHT

... and throw your ball at anyone.

The ball fight can last for a moment, until people get tired.
