### How to play
Create a house by having two people facing each other and join their hands together in the air to for the left and right wall of the house.
A tenant should stand in the house, in the middle of both other people.

When the facilitator indicates
* `left`, all the _left walls_ of the house run around to find another house.
* `right`, all _right walls_ of the house run around to find another house.
* `tenant`, all tenants of the house run around to find another house.
* `full house`, all parts of the house run around to create a complete new house.

Make sure people have enough space to run around.
