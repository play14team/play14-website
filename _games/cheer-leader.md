## HOW TO PLAY

* Have people walk around the room
* Have them pair-up and introduce themselves
* Then, they will play 1 round of rock-paper-scissors
* The winner will continue looking for another person to play with
* The looser will get behind the winner and start cheering their name

* At the end of the game, there should be 2 long lines of people cheering for the person in front
* When the two persons who are in front meet, they play rock-paper-scissors, 1 of them becomes the champion and the whole room cheers for them
