## How do I become a #play14 event host ?

The main condition to become a **#play14** host, is that you have participated to **at least one** event as an attendee.
The reason for that is that we want you to feel what it is like to be part of the family, and comprehend the mindset that we are looking for, before you can to become an host.

As an host, you will commit to carry on the philosophy of the original event and provide a rich experience to your future attendees.

Most of what you will have to do as an host is provide

- A venue
- A date
- Food & drinks
- Some material for playing
- Your good mood

The rest is up to the players.

To make sure that it is not too much work, we recommend that you have at least 3 local organizers.
This is specially true if you need to look for a venue.

## How do I choose a venue ?

The venue should be big enough to hold 30 to 70 people, depending on how many people you expect.
Our venues are usually special locations, with a sort of nice "je ne sais quoi".

The venue should have at least

- A common area
  - where the whole group can gather for ice breakers and warm-ups
  - where the market place will be hang visibly on the wall
- A food corner
  - where people can grab a bite
  - where drinks & snacks will be provided at any time
- 3 or more separate gaming areas
  - with tables & chairs
  - with a whiteboard or a paperboard
  - big enought so that people can walk around tables

Obsiously, the number of people you can host depends on the size of the venue.

## What materials & supplies should I foresee ?

This following is a non exhaustive list of all sorts of things you should foresee for a well organized **#play14** event

- Tables & chairs (should come with the venue)
- Whiteboards & paperboards
- Lots of stiky notes
  - Large stickies for the market place
  - Square (yellow & colors)
  - Long (yellow & colors)
- Sharpies & Markers
  - At least one Sharpie for each per player
  - Paperboard markers
  - Whiteboard markers
- Large paper roll for the market place
- Masking tape
- Scissors
- Mesureing tape
- Paper (white & color)
- Game marterial
  - A box of plastic balls
  - Poker chips
  - Card decks
  - Any other game you can think of

## What about food & drinks ?

If you want people to maintain a hight level of energy troughout the event, you need to feed them, and get them drinks.
This is one of the major responsibilities of a host.

### Lunch & Dinner

We usually foresee 2 lunches and 2 dinners

- First dinner : Welcome dinner, should be festive, usually asking a ceterer
- First lunch : Light lunch, but copious enough so people can last the whole afternoon playing
- Second dinner : Ususally pizza and beer. No fuss.
- Lunch : Light lunch, if possible different from the day before to provide variety

Diversity is good, also in food. Be sure you pay attention to specific diets, like vegan or gluten-free.

### Drinks

Always have hot and fresh drinks at the ready. Everyone should be able to serve themselves a drink at any point of time.

- Coffee
- Tea
- Water
- Coke
- Orange juice
- Beer
- Wine

It's your decision as a host to serve alcoholic beverages during the meals or not.
We usally recommend it for the dinners at least, to make things a bit more cheerful.
People are responsible enough to pay attention to their consumption and not get hammered.

### Snacks

It's always a good thing to have snacks around, for breakfast and during the day, in case people need some energy

- Pasteries (for breakfast)
- Fresh fruits
- Cereal bars
- Chocolate bars

## What can I expect from #play14 Global Organization ?

**#play14** global organization will provide you with some shared resources and the co-founders will help you host your event.
You won't be alone in this adventure. We have a Slack account that helps us keep in touch with all local organizers and we keep ourselves available for video conferencing if need be.

One of the co-founders at least will be present during the event to help you with the organization and to make sure that the spirit of **#play14** is respected.

### #play14 Website & regisrtation

We will create a page for your event on the **#play14** website and provide all necessary information : location, dates, registration.
We can handle ticketing and financial aspects for you.

You can also use your own registration system if you have one.

### Marketing & communication

We have different communication tools and marketing services already in place

- Twitter
- Linkedin
- Xing
- Google
- Youtube
- Facebook
- Newsletter (Mailchimp)

You wil mainly be in charge of communicating about your event and bringing people to register.
However, at any moment you may ask for help and have one of the co-founder provide you access to the tools & services in place.

### Merchandizing & welcome kit

We usually foresee a _welcome kit_ for every participant, including the following merchandizing

- A #play14 t-shirt
- A #play14 sticker
- A _LEGO Servious Play_ window kit

It's up to you to add other things that you make have at your disposal

- Sticky notes
- Sharpie
- Story cubes
- Venue or sponsor merchandizing

## What about budget & revenue ?

Generaly speaking, we try to keep the ticket price as low as possible, because we want as many people to participate as possible.
The money is mainly spent on food & drinks, welcome kits, materials & supplies.
It may also be spent on the venue, if the it is not free.

### Tickets

Ticket sales are the main source of income for a #play14 event.

Depending on the location and the decision of the local organizers, the price of the tickets might be adapted.

Some events manage to get a venue for free. This makes things much easier in terms of budget.
If you need to pay for a venue, the price of the tickets will have to increase significantly and you might have to save some money on the rest.

The types of ticket can also be adapted. Some organizers want to sell only tickets for the whole event, some sell tickets per day.
Some organizers setup an evolutive princing : early birds, normal birds and late birds.

Depending on your context, this can be discussed with the co-founders and any of the other local organizers who can provide some ideas and feedback.

### Sponsors

Ideally, you should find sponsors to help you organize a quality event.

Sponsoring can take many forms

- Money
- Free venue
- Food & drinks
- Materials
- Games

It's up to you as a local event host to find some sponsors for your event.

### Presence of one of the co-founders

As a rule, we want to have at least one of the origianl co-founder present at any **#play14** event.
This is to ensure that you are not alone and that everything is running smoothly.

Because it incurs some travelling and accomodation fees, a part of the budget of a **#play14** event has to be dedicated to that extent.

### Profit & loss

**#play14** is non-profit.

Hence, any benefit you make on your event will be reinvested in the next event.
On the opposite, any financial loss you might endure will be supported by the **#play14** global organization.

All our events ususally break even, and so far we haven't had any major financial issue.
