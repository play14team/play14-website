      <h2>Our history</h2>
      <div class="spacing"></div>
      <p>
        It all started from some frustration and one crazy idea. End of 2013,
        some of us tried to register for
        <a href="https://play4agile.wordpress.com/">play4agile</a>, but all
        tickets were sold out in a few hours. Twitter started buzzing and people
        complained. Instead of spending time bitching and crying about it
        though, we just decided that there was something better to do. Why not
        create an event of our own instead of complaining?
      </p>
      <p>
        In December 2013, <a href="/players/yann-gensollen">Yann</a>,
        <a href="/players/pierre-neis">Pierre</a> and
        <a href="/players/cedric-pontet">Cédric</a> gathered in a bar in
        Luxembourg to give it a serious thought. What would it take to organize
        an unconference about serious games ? We would need a venue, a date, and
        a name.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding the venue, Yann and Cédric asked
        <a href="/players/diego-de-biasio">Diego</a>, CEO of the
        <a href="http://www.technoport.lu">Technoport</a> in Esch/Belval, whom
        they already new from organizing the
        <a href="http://www.up.co/communities/luxembourg/luxembourg/"
          >Startup Weekend Luxembourg</a
        >. Diego being who he is, he immediatly said yes, and we had our
        venue... for free. #play14 would not exist if not for Diego and we all
        thank him for that.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the date, we thought that March 2014 would be a good time. That gave
        us 3 months to prepare and advertize. It was short, but we liked the
        challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name, was actually the hardest to come up with. Brainstorming for a
        while, after a lot of stupid ideas, we just came up with the number 14.
        Why 14 ? Because why not ! Since you cannot create a domain name with
        just a number, we added 'play' in front and decided that the name of the
        event would be the hashtag, and not the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously we had to check with the guys from play4agile if they were ok
        with us organizing a like-minded event in Luxembourg, which they were,
        and that was it! Three month later, on March 14th 2014, the very first
        #play14 event started.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back then, we had no idea if it would work, of what it would eventually
        become, and that a couple of years later, #play14 would be present all
        around Europe. The rest is history...

      <h2>Acknowldegement</h2>
      <p>
        We would like to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation to
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christianjolas">Christian Jolas</a>
        / <a href="https://twitter.com/cjolas">@cjolas</a> who designed our
        logo. Christian was nice enough to spend his precious time imagining
        different popositions for the #play14 logo. After some hesitations, we
        decided to go for the simple and colorful logo as it is today.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were pretty happy with our choice, but it's only when we saw it
        printed on the black t-shirts for the first time, and when we looked at
        the pictures after the first event, that we realized that what Christian
        had given us was not only a great logo, but an extraordinary visual
        identity.
      </p>
      <p>So many thanks to you, Christian. We owe you that much.</p>
